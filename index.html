        “A thousand years or more ago,
        When I was newly sewn,
        There lived four wizards of renown,
        Whose name are still well-known:
        Bold Gryffindor from wild moor,
        Fair Ravlenclaw from glen,
        Sweet Hufflepuff from valley broad,
        Shrewd Slytherin from fen.
        They share a wish, a hope, a dream,
        They hatched a daring plan,
        To educate young sorcerers,
        Thus Hogwarts school began.
        Now each of these four founders
        Formed their own house, for each
        Did value different virtues,
        In the ones they had to teach.
        By Gryffindor, the bravest were
        Prized far beyond the rest;
        For Ravenclaw, the cleverest
        Would always be the best;
        For Hufflepuff, hardworkers were
        Most worthy of admission;
        And power-hungry Slytherin
        Loved those of great ambition.
        While still alive they did divide
        Their favourates from the throng,
        Yet how to pick the worthy ones
        When they were dead and gone?
        'Twas Gryffindor who found the way,
        He whipped me off his head
        The founders put some brains in me
        So I could choose instead!
        Now slip me snug around your ears,
        I've never yet been wrong,
        I'll have alook inside your mind
        And tell where you belong!” -JK Rowling
